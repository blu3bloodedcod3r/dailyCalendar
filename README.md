This daily calendar will help sort your daily work schedule by being able to see what has past and what the future holds by red and green maeking part/ pressent events.

- WMy motivation was to learn how to further use JQuery and Boostrap for future needs.
- I built this project so that I can practie my skills for JQuery and Bootsrap and incorporating these into new applications.
- This solves the problem of forgetting daily tasks by color coding daily time frames.
- I learned how to incorporate JAQuery and Boostrp API's.
